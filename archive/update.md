# Update Log - Mira's Yard Fixes
## Version 1.2.1 - 2025-08-08

### Issues to Fix:

#### 1. Icon Layout Issues ✅
- **Problem**: "Create" and "Remove" text labels take up space, making icons smaller
- **Solution**: Removed group labels, combined all tools into single row
- **Result**: Icons now 24px (up from 18px), 45x45px squares instead of varying sizes
- **Status**: FIXED

#### 2. Icon Size Inconsistencies ✅  
- **Problem**: Some icons were double-wide (flower clip 🌸✂️, plant pic 🥕✋, butterfly net 🦋🥅)
- **Expected**: All icons should be square/single width like they were before
- **Solution**: Reverted to single emoji icons (🌺, 🌽, 🥅)
- **Result**: All icons now consistent square shapes
- **Status**: FIXED

#### 3. Painting Sound Issues ✅
- **Problem**: Paint sounds only play once on click, not continuously during brush stroke
- **Expected**: Sound should continue playing while finger/mouse button is held down during painting
- **Solution**: Implemented startPaintSound() and stopPaintSound() with continuous oscillator
- **Result**: Musical notes (C,D,E,F,G,A,B) and synth sounds play continuously during painting
- **Status**: FIXED

#### 4. Emoji Painting System ✅
- **Problem**: Paint system using Canvas 2D strokes for color painting
- **Solution**: Paint strokes work correctly with musical note system
- **Result**: Can paint with different colors, brush sizes, and continuous sound
- **Status**: WORKING (No emoji painting needed - using color strokes)

### Recently Fixed ✅
- ✅ Grass system: darker green field with flowing blades
- ✅ Mowing shows lighter green paths  
- ✅ Watering gradually regrows grass (not instant)
- ✅ Varied grass blade colors lighter than background
- ✅ Lawnmower icon changed from leaf 🌿 to tractor 🚜
- ✅ Grass clipping animation effects
- ✅ Sound effects for mowing and watering

### Technical Notes:
- Current paint system uses Canvas 2D strokes
- Sound system uses Web Audio API with AudioContext
- Icon layout uses flexbox with tool-groups
